# Security Incidents Analysis

This project deals with analyzing Past Security Incidents (1997-2025) for Informed Decision-Making and using machine learning model to predict future trends on security incidences.

# Overview
This project analyzes past security incidents affecting aid workers from 1997 to 2025. The goal is to identify trends, high-risk regions, and key security threats to aid operations. The insights can help stakeholders implement better safety measures and reduce the risks faced by humanitarian workers.

# Dataset
The dataset is sourced from Aid Worker Security Database and contains details about security incidents, including:

Country & Region affected
Means of attack (e.g., shooting, kidnapping, ambush)
Context & Motives behind attacks
Total affected, killed, wounded, and kidnapped

# Objectives
Identify high-risk countries and regions where aid workers are most affected.
Analyze trends in security incidents over time.
Understand common threats (e.g., shootings, kidnappings, assaults) to aid workers.
Provide actionable insights to improve security measures in humanitarian operations.

# Methodology
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for trends and patterns

Machine Learning Models (Random Forest & Gradient Boosting) to predict incident severity

Data Visualization using maps and charts to highlight key insights
